## Part of Coursera's *Data Analysis and Visualization with Python* with Microsoft

The purpose of this activity is to equip you with the skills to explore and visualize music data effectively. You will learn how to load and examine a real-world music dataset using pandas, a powerful data analysis library in Python. You'll then use Python libraries to create a variety of visualizations, ranging from basic bar charts and histograms to more advanced heatmaps and violin plots.
